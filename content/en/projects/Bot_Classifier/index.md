## Bot Classifier

I created and automated a Bot-or-Not Classification Model for Edgio, allowing customers to defend against more sophisticated bots based on a configurable threshold. For our client Shoe Carnival, our ML-powered bot solution blocked 8M malicious requests in one month and reduced security exploit mitigation time by 85%. See details on the bot solution [here](https://meet.edg.io/advanced-bot-manager/)
