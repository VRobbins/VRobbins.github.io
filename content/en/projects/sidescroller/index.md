## Alien Invasion

This is a Sidescroller written in C++ using the Qt Creator and an Event-Driven Programming Scheme. This Project was completed in collaboration with Darren Atallah, Weiyu Huang, and Peter Liu. Among other things, I was responsible for handling user input, player abilities, and optimizing program efficiency.
